                        <p>Avatara Software is a software development company focusing on web-based
                            management systems primarily for Canada's labour and nuclear industries. Their
                            systems offer solutions to these unions and businesses that are tailor-made to their
                            specific requirements. With only 4 full-time employees, this company has had an
                            impressive impact on the market, taking on massive clients such as Black & McDonald,
                            the IBEW, and E.S. Fox Ltd. As a small company, they’ve made their name in this
                            industry through their ability to form close relationships with their clients and deliver
                            functional, effective products consistently and quickly.</p>
                        <p>
                            Avatara Software primarily focuses on four types of software systems; quality
                            management, training compliance management, market recovery/STAB, and apprentice
                            management. Avatara creates custom web management tools to help its clients simplify
                            and organize their current systems. Their goal is to make the lives and jobs of their
                            clients easier through these well-made, easy-to-use systems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What sets Avatara apart from the rest is its client-based approach to its development
                            process. Not only acknowledging what the customer wants but fully comprehending the
                            problem the client has, allows the company to better understand the implicit needs of
                            their customers. This allows them to create incredibly tailored solutions that are intuitive
                            to the user. Furthermore, their process of constantly returning to the client during
                            development and receiving their input to improve the product further aids in creating an
                            end-product the client loves.

                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p>As a full-stack developer, this term I worked on an array of different projects,
                            continuously switching from back-end to front-end. As an introductory project, I worked
                            with another co-op student to update the company’s in-house, time-tracking software
                            to a new PHP framework. This project allowed me to simultaneously learn Laravel,
                            MySQL, and Codeigniter while learning about the company’s development standards
                            and best practices. As work on that project slowed, I was pulled into numerous other
                            projects ranging from action-tracking systems for Black and McDonald to a materials
                            management system for E.S. Fox Ltd.</p>
                        <p>
                            However, my primary focus this term was on an apprentice tracking system for IBEW
                            Local 586. The goal of this project was to provide a new user interface for the
                            apprentices to view their progress, as well as incorporate a new apprentice stream into
                            their pre-existing system. My main contribution to this project was the front-end portion
                            of the new UI for the apprentices. I was tasked with building new pages where the
                            apprentices could log in to view their data and progress within their respective streams.
                            This project allowed me to further my understanding of the MVC design structure, as
                            well as front-end packages like Bootstrap 5 and jQuery. This project helped me to refine
                            my pre-existing front-end development skills and later gain more experience with back-
                            end development.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Throughout this term, I gained valuable insights into the company’s business. Working
                            on the time-tracking software and engaging with colleagues at conventions helped me
                            understand how the business operates and what drives its success. Avatara’s ability to
                            build lasting relationships with clients has allowed their business to prosper, thanks to
                            its reputation and reliability. It was incredible to witness clients enthusiastically promote
                            Avatara’s systems to their peers at conventions, almost as if they were pitching the
                            product themselves. This experience highlighted for me not only the importance of
                            creating effective systems but also how strong, meaningful relationships with clients are
                            key to sustained business growth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In all, this first term with Avatara has been incredibly informative, allowing me to learn
                            and develop so many unique skills I would have never gained elsewhere. I came into
                            this term with goals of learning more about the software development industry,
                            improving my professional collaboration skills, and becoming an all-around better
                            programmer. It is safe to say that during this term I have achieved all these goals—and
                            more. The team at Avatara has been supportive throughout, encouraging me to take on
                            new challenges, try different approaches, and push myself to grow. I’m eager to
                            continue building on what I’ve learned and take on new opportunities for growth in the
                            future.
