                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p>Avatara Software is a software development company focusing on web-based
                            management systems primarily for Canada's labour and nuclear industries. Their
                            systems offer solutions to these unions and businesses that are tailor-made to their
                            specific requirements. With only 4 full-time employees, this company has had an
                            impressive impact on the market, taking on massive clients such as Black & McDonald,
                            the IBEW, and E.S. Fox Ltd. As a small company, they’ve made their name in this
                            industry through their ability to form close relationships with their clients and deliver
                            functional, effective products consistently and quickly.</p>
                        <p>
                            Avatara Software primarily focuses on four types of software systems; quality
                            management, training compliance management, market recovery/STAB, and apprentice
                            management. Avatara creates custom web management tools to help its clients simplify
                            and organize their current systems. Their goal is to make the lives and jobs of their
                            clients easier through these well-made, easy-to-use systems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What sets Avatara apart from the rest is its client-based approach to its development
                            process. Not only acknowledging what the customer wants but fully comprehending the
                            problem the client has, allows the company to better understand the implicit needs of
                            their customers. This allows them to create incredibly tailored solutions that are intuitive
                            to the user. Furthermore, their process of constantly returning to the client during
                            development and receiving their input to improve the product further aids in creating an
                            end-product the client loves.

                            <h5>Summer 2024</h5>
                            <p>As a full-stack developer, this term I worked on an array of different projects,
                                continuously switching from back-end to front-end. As an introductory project, I worked
                                with another co-op student to update the company’s in-house, time-tracking software
                                to a new PHP framework. This project allowed me to simultaneously learn Laravel,
                                MySQL, and Codeigniter while learning about the company’s development standards
                                and best practices. As work on that project slowed, I was pulled into numerous other
                                projects ranging from action-tracking systems for Black and McDonald to a materials
                                management system for E.S. Fox Ltd.</p>
                            <p>
                                However, my primary focus this term was on an apprentice tracking system for IBEW
                                Local 586. The goal of this project was to provide a new user interface for the
                                apprentices to view their progress, as well as incorporate a new apprentice stream into
                                their pre-existing system. My main contribution to this project was the front-end portion
                                of the new UI for the apprentices. I was tasked with building new pages where the
                                apprentices could log in to view their data and progress within their respective streams.
                                This project allowed me to further my understanding of the MVC design structure, as
                                well as front-end packages like Bootstrap 5 and jQuery. This project helped me to refine
                                my pre-existing front-end development skills and later gain more experience with back-
                                end development.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Throughout this term, I gained valuable insights into the company’s business. Working
                                on the time-tracking software and engaging with colleagues at conventions helped me
                                understand how the business operates and what drives its success. Avatara’s ability to
                                build lasting relationships with clients has allowed their business to prosper, thanks to
                                its reputation and reliability. It was incredible to witness clients enthusiastically promote
                                Avatara’s systems to their peers at conventions, almost as if they were pitching the
                                product themselves. This experience highlighted for me not only the importance of
                                creating effective systems but also how strong, meaningful relationships with clients are
                                key to sustained business growth.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In all, this first term with Avatara has been incredibly informative, allowing me to learn
                                and develop so many unique skills I would have never gained elsewhere. I came into
                                this term with goals of learning more about the software development industry,
                                improving my professional collaboration skills, and becoming an all-around better
                                programmer. It is safe to say that during this term I have achieved all these goals—and
                                more. The team at Avatara has been supportive throughout, encouraging me to take on
                                new challenges, try different approaches, and push myself to grow. I’m eager to
                                continue building on what I’ve learned and take on new opportunities for growth in the
                                future.

                            <p>This semester I completed my second semester of my 8-month full stack developer co-op with Avatara Software.
                                 I continued my work at the company, working on various projects both on the front and backend sides.
                                Along with expanding upon my programming skills this semester, I was also given the opportunity to work on my soft skills,
                                by engaging and interacting with clients. All around, this semester – as well as the entire work term – has been incredibly
                                informative and helpful as I begin my career in the computer science field.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During my work term, I had the opportunity to work on various projects that allowed me to gain invaluable knowledge
                                and continuously sharpen my skill set. Through hands-on experience, conversations with my colleagues, and reading books
                                and articles, I made a lot of progress in my goal of expanding my knowledge of technology as well as the labour and trade
                                industries of Canada. When I began my co-op at Avatara, I had little experience working with or developing on Windows systems. 
                                However, by using Windows devices every day, I gradually gained proficiency in using the system. Moreover, my exposure to the 
                                tech industry and its current standards and best practices has deepened my overall understanding of the field.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One area where I made vast improvements in was my coding practices. I implemented my own code review process, where I would 
                                review all my work at the end of the day or the following morning. This allowed me to catch more errors and refine my code, 
                                ultimately improving the quality of my work. By taking this extra step in reviewing my own code later rather then immediately 
                                after writing the code, I felt I developed better attention to detail and became more confident in my work.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This semester I was given the opportunity of working on a new app from the beginning of the development process. This experience
                                has largely developed my backend and client-relations skills. Working from the base of the app, I got to learn about database
                                schemas, packages, and frameworks. This app required both French and English language capabilities, which presented me with the
                                unique opportunity of learning about Laravel localization and methods of dynamic and static translations. The process of learning
                                about localization not only expanded my knowledge of that functionality, but of Laravel as a whole.  On the client-side of things,
                                I also got to work on my client-communication skills by emailing and connecting with clients about the app and development process.
                                This opportunity has helped me not only to build relationships with the clients but also grow confidence in that respect. Overall, 
                                this app has given me a more complete understanding of Avatara’s process and allowed me to gain and grow both programming and client skills.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I was also given the opportunity to work on my communication skills and expand my knowledge of the industry at the Organization 
                                of Canadian Nuclear Industries (OCNI) / Ontario Power Generation (OPG) Suppliers Day conference. Communication at conferences was 
                                an area I specifically wanted to improve, so I used this event to refine those skills while learning about the different companies 
                                in attendance. By practicing my pitch and drawing on the experience I had gained in the months prior, I was able to build confidence 
                                and engage more effectively with attendees. Conversations with attendees provided me with a deeper understanding of the various elements 
                                of the nuclear and labor industries, further enhancing my industry knowledge.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In conclusion, over these past 8 months and especially during this work term, working at Avatara Software has been an incredible and 
                                invaluable experience. I have grown significantly as a software developer, gaining far more knowledge and skills than I ever anticipated. 
                                The experiences offered to me have far exceeded my expectations as I truly got to experience what it is like to work in the industry. 
                                I am grateful to everyone I worked with at Avatara—it's not only a great company, but also one with an amazing team behind it. 
                                I’m excited to continue collaborating with such talented individuals and look forward to what the future holds.
