                                      Hello, and welcome! My name is <strong>Amy Beard</strong>, and I’m a fourth-year Software Engineering, Co-Op student at the University of Guelph.
                                      Over the past few years, my studies have given me a broad foundation across the many layers of software engineering, from low-level systems
                                        to high-level design.
                                      </p>

                                      <p>
                                      Outside of the classroom, I’m currently working at <strong>Avatara Software</strong> as a full-stack developer.
                                      Because it’s a smaller company, I’ve had the unique opportunity to contribute across the entire stack—whether that means designing 
                                      intuitive front-end experiences, building reliable back-end systems, or making sure everything fits together seamlessly.
                                      Much of my work focuses on developing <strong>web-based management systems</strong> that support Canada’s trade and labour sectors,
                                      a field where good software can make a meaningful difference in efficiency and accessibility.
                                      </p>

                                      <p>
                                      Beyond computer science, I’m deeply passionate about the arts. I spend a lot of my free time <strong>drawing, exploring fibre arts, and 
                                      reading</strong>, and I make a point of visiting galleries and museums whenever I can. For me, creativity isn’t just a hobby—it’s something
                                      I bring back into my technical work, helping me to attack complex problems fromm a creative perspecitve.
                                      </p>

                                      <p>
                                      As I look ahead, I’m excited about opportunities where I can continue to bridge <strong>engineering and creativity</strong>—roles that challenge 
                                      me to think critically about both the technical details and the human experience of the systems I build. I’m eager to keep learning, experimenting,
                                      and contributing solutions that are both functional and thoughtful.
                                      </p>
