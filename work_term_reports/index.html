                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p>Avatara Software is a software development company focusing on web-based
                            management systems primarily for Canada's labour and nuclear industries. Their
                            systems offer solutions to these unions and businesses that are tailor-made to their
                            specific requirements. With only 4 full-time employees, this company has had an
                            impressive impact on the market, taking on massive clients such as Black & McDonald,
                            the IBEW, and E.S. Fox Ltd. As a small company, they’ve made their name in this
                            industry through their ability to form close relationships with their clients and deliver
                            functional, effective products consistently and quickly.</p>
                        <p>
                            Avatara Software primarily focuses on four types of software systems; quality
                            management, training compliance management, market recovery/STAB, and apprentice
                            management. Avatara creates custom web management tools to help its clients simplify
                            and organize their current systems. Their goal is to make the lives and jobs of their
                            clients easier through these well-made, easy-to-use systems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What sets Avatara apart from the rest is its client-based approach to its development
                            process. Not only acknowledging what the customer wants but fully comprehending the
                            problem the client has, allows the company to better understand the implicit needs of
                            their customers. This allows them to create incredibly tailored solutions that are intuitive
                            to the user. Furthermore, their process of constantly returning to the client during
                            development and receiving their input to improve the product further aids in creating an
                            end-product the client loves.

                            <p>As a full-stack developer, this term I worked on an array of different projects,
                                continuously switching from back-end to front-end. As an introductory project, I worked
                                with another co-op student to update the company’s in-house, time-tracking software
                                to a new PHP framework. This project allowed me to simultaneously learn Laravel,
                                MySQL, and Codeigniter while learning about the company’s development standards
                                and best practices. As work on that project slowed, I was pulled into numerous other
                                projects ranging from action-tracking systems for Black and McDonald to a materials
                                management system for E.S. Fox Ltd.</p>
                            <p>
                                However, my primary focus this term was on an apprentice tracking system for IBEW
                                Local 586. The goal of this project was to provide a new user interface for the
                                apprentices to view their progress, as well as incorporate a new apprentice stream into
                                their pre-existing system. My main contribution to this project was the front-end portion
                                of the new UI for the apprentices. I was tasked with building new pages where the
                                apprentices could log in to view their data and progress within their respective streams.
                                This project allowed me to further my understanding of the MVC design structure, as
                                well as front-end packages like Bootstrap 5 and jQuery. This project helped me to refine
                                my pre-existing front-end development skills and later gain more experience with back-
                                end development.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Throughout this term, I gained valuable insights into the company’s business. Working
                                on the time-tracking software and engaging with colleagues at conventions helped me
                                understand how the business operates and what drives its success. Avatara’s ability to
                                build lasting relationships with clients has allowed their business to prosper, thanks to
                                its reputation and reliability. It was incredible to witness clients enthusiastically promote
                                Avatara’s systems to their peers at conventions, almost as if they were pitching the
                                product themselves. This experience highlighted for me not only the importance of
                                creating effective systems but also how strong, meaningful relationships with clients are
                                key to sustained business growth.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In all, this first term with Avatara has been incredibly informative, allowing me to learn
                                and develop so many unique skills I would have never gained elsewhere. I came into
                                this term with goals of learning more about the software development industry,
                                improving my professional collaboration skills, and becoming an all-around better
                                programmer. It is safe to say that during this term I have achieved all these goals—and
                                more. The team at Avatara has been supportive throughout, encouraging me to take on
                                new challenges, try different approaches, and push myself to grow. I’m eager to
                                continue building on what I’ve learned and take on new opportunities for growth in the
                                future.

                            <p>This semester I completed my second semester of my 8-month full stack developer co-op with Avatara Software.
                                 I continued my work at the company, working on various projects both on the front and backend sides.
                                Along with expanding upon my programming skills this semester, I was also given the opportunity to work on my soft skills,
                                by engaging and interacting with clients. All around, this semester – as well as the entire work term – has been incredibly
                                informative and helpful as I begin my career in the computer science field.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During my work term, I had the opportunity to work on various projects that allowed me to gain invaluable knowledge
                                and continuously sharpen my skill set. Through hands-on experience, conversations with my colleagues, and reading books
                                and articles, I made a lot of progress in my goal of expanding my knowledge of technology as well as the labour and trade
                                industries of Canada. When I began my co-op at Avatara, I had little experience working with or developing on Windows systems. 
                                However, by using Windows devices every day, I gradually gained proficiency in using the system. Moreover, my exposure to the 
                                tech industry and its current standards and best practices has deepened my overall understanding of the field.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One area where I made vast improvements in was my coding practices. I implemented my own code review process, where I would 
                                review all my work at the end of the day or the following morning. This allowed me to catch more errors and refine my code, 
                                ultimately improving the quality of my work. By taking this extra step in reviewing my own code later rather then immediately 
                                after writing the code, I felt I developed better attention to detail and became more confident in my work.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This semester I was given the opportunity of working on a new app from the beginning of the development process. This experience
                                has largely developed my backend and client-relations skills. Working from the base of the app, I got to learn about database
                                schemas, packages, and frameworks. This app required both French and English language capabilities, which presented me with the
                                unique opportunity of learning about Laravel localization and methods of dynamic and static translations. The process of learning
                                about localization not only expanded my knowledge of that functionality, but of Laravel as a whole.  On the client-side of things,
                                I also got to work on my client-communication skills by emailing and connecting with clients about the app and development process.
                                This opportunity has helped me not only to build relationships with the clients but also grow confidence in that respect. Overall, 
                                this app has given me a more complete understanding of Avatara’s process and allowed me to gain and grow both programming and client skills.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I was also given the opportunity to work on my communication skills and expand my knowledge of the industry at the Organization 
                                of Canadian Nuclear Industries (OCNI) / Ontario Power Generation (OPG) Suppliers Day conference. Communication at conferences was 
                                an area I specifically wanted to improve, so I used this event to refine those skills while learning about the different companies 
                                in attendance. By practicing my pitch and drawing on the experience I had gained in the months prior, I was able to build confidence 
                                and engage more effectively with attendees. Conversations with attendees provided me with a deeper understanding of the various elements 
                                of the nuclear and labor industries, further enhancing my industry knowledge.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In conclusion, over these past 8 months and especially during this work term, working at Avatara Software has been an incredible and 
                                invaluable experience. I have grown significantly as a software developer, gaining far more knowledge and skills than I ever anticipated. 
                                The experiences offered to me have far exceeded my expectations as I truly got to experience what it is like to work in the industry. 
                                I am grateful to everyone I worked with at Avatara—it's not only a great company, but also one with an amazing team behind it. 
                                I’m excited to continue collaborating with such talented individuals and look forward to what the future holds.

                            <p>
                                This summer I completed my third full-stack developer co-op with Avatara
                                Software. Each term with this team has challenged me in new ways, and this
                                one was no exception. I spent the semester moving up and down the
                                stack—designing database schemas, writing import tools, building a reusable
                                package, and fitting new workflows into existing apps. The result was a term
                                that felt both challenging and coherent: a series of projects that sharpened
                                my judgment while reinforcing habits I've been building around
                                documentation, independent problem-solving, and thoughtful pacing.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Being on a small team means seeing projects end-to-end: meeting with clients
                                to understand what they need, sketching a plan, building it, reviewing it,
                                and polishing the details so it holds up after it ships. It also means your
                                decisions matter; the way you shape a feature today becomes someone else's
                                daily workflow tomorrow. That sense of responsibility guided how I worked
                                this term.
                            </p>

                                One of my larger projects was moving a client's annotated records from
                                spreadsheets into our system for a major Canadian nuclear-industry partner.
                                I built a tool that gathers the information, tidies it up, and imports it
                                safely, with checks so we can validate the importer's effectiveness. The
                                most valuable part was working closely with the client to agree on what each
                                field meant and how to handle the odd cases. The project taught me about the
                                practical challenges of data migration and the nuances of extracting and
                                importing data across different formats and platforms.

                                I also helped turn a paper-and-email purchasing workflow into software by
                                contributing a purchase requisition module for Black &amp; McDonald's
                                material-management system. The goal was to fold requisitions and approvals
                                into the existing application without disrupting what already worked. The
                                most interesting piece was approvals sequencing: I implemented manual
                                reordering of approvers using DataTables RowReorder so users could drag to
                                set the approval path, then connected that to back-end logic that saves the
                                sequence, enforces rules, and keeps the flow consistent. With steady reviews
                                from my supervisor, I worked through the integration details and delivered
                                the module successfully.

                                My last key project changed how I think about building software. I created a
                                small package that plugs into one of our existing packages to add a feature
                                without changing the original. The "meta" nature of that work felt tricky at
                                first, but working with my supervisor and a teammate helped me make the
                                setup clear and the package easy to adopt. I focused on straightforward
                                setup steps, efficient integration, and solid documentation so teams could
                                enable it without touching internals. The extra time I spent on self-review
                                paid off: code review came back with only minor notes, reinforcing that
                                slower, more deliberate work leads to smoother integrations.

                                At the start of the term I set a handful of goals, and they shaped how I
                                approached my days. I wanted to deepen my understanding of the lower-level
                                parts of our stack and rely less on quick searches or old snippets.
                                Practically, that meant spending time with official documentation and
                                building mental models I could carry from project to project. The payoff
                                showed up in small but important moments—like diagnosing and fixing a tricky
                                import issue on my own using our database tools. It was a good reminder that
                                investing in fundamentals makes the rest of the work calmer.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I also aimed to lead with my own solution before checking how teammates had
                                done it in the past. I still validate against team patterns, but starting
                                with my own plan changed the tone of reviews from "does this match?" to "is
                                this the best trade-off?" That shift was especially helpful on the package
                                work.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another focus was writing. Outside of work I took a history-on-film course
                                with weekly responses and quick feedback, and that steady practice carried
                                over into my READMEs and commenting. I started drafting earlier, revising
                                more intentionally, and writing with the reader's questions in mind. The
                                result was clearer documentation that will aid future developers.

                                Finally, I worked on pacing. I tend to sprint when I'm excited, which can
                                create avoidable rework. This term I stuck to a self-review routine—blocking
                                time to re-read and test my code before shipping—and it made a real
                                difference. Tickets came back less often and with smaller changes.
                            </p>

                                Overall, the projects I worked on this term covered a broad range of topics
                                and pushed my skills further than I expected. With each new project, I felt
                                grateful for the opportunity to learn more.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I'm grateful to the Avatara team for thoughtful reviews, generous
                                mentorship, and the trust to learn by doing. I'm also thankful to our
                                clients for collaborating closely during migrations and workflow design;
                                those conversations make the software better. Next term, I'm excited to keep
                                building at the intersection of engineering and usability—deepening my
                                understanding of the stack, taking on more package-level and architectural
                                work, and continuing the habits that made this summer both productive and
                                sustainable.
